## 🎯 Project Goals

- Simulate a **Robot Arm Palletizer** in Unity capable of automatic pick-and-place operations.  
- Support **different palletizing patterns**, number of layers, and **variable box sizes**.  
- Design a **user-friendly, interactive interface** for configuring palletizing parameters in real-time.  
- Implement **VR interaction**, allowing users to experience and control the robotic arm in immersive virtual reality.  
- Maintain **correct joint hierarchy and rotation limits** for realistic mechanical motion.  
- Provide a flexible framework for **future extensions**, such as multi-arm coordination or dynamic obstacle handling.  
- Serve as an educational and experimental platform for **industrial robotics simulation**.
